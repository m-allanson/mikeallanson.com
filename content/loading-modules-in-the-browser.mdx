# Loading Modules in the Browser

Use:

```js
<script type="module" src="myFile.js"></script>
```

The `defer` attribute is automatically implied. `defer` allows the browser to download and parse the script in parallel with HTML parsing. The script is executed after the document has been parsed, but before `DOMContentLoaded`.

Scripts will execute in the order they appear in the document.

## The `async` attribute

Use the `async` attribute like this:

```js
<script type="module" src="myFile.js" async></script>
```

The `async` attribute causes the script to execute as soon as it's been downloaded. Interrupting HTML parsing if necessary.

This disables 'in-order' execution of the script. It will execute as soon as possible.
