# Understanding Focus in the Browser

It's difficult to implement good [a11y](https://a11y.coffee/) for a web app without first understanding `focus`.

I've practical knowledge of focus and how it works, particularly in relation to DOM events and CSS. I've limited theoretical knowledge about it.

Questions:

- What _is_ focus?
- What (precisely) can be focussed?
- What are the implications of an element being focussed?
- Relationship between focus, ARIA attributes and assistive tech like screen readers?
